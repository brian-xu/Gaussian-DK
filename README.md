## Requirements

* Linux OS
* NVIDIA GPUs. We experimented on A6000 GPUs (cuda 11.8).
* Python libraries: see [environment.yml](./environment.yml). You can use the following commands with Anaconda3 to create and activate your virtual environment:
  - `git clone https://github.com/yec22/Gaussian-DK.git`
  - `cd Gaussian-DK`
  - `conda env create -f environment.yml`
  - `conda activate 3dgs_dk`

## Dataset

## Usage

First, please make sure that all requirements are satisfied and all required files are downloaded (see above steps).

```
bash run.sh
```
