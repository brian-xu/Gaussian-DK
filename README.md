# Gaussian in the Dark ðŸ˜ˆ

This repository contains the official authors implementation associated with the paper "Gaussian in the Dark: Real-Time View Synthesis From Inconsistent Dark Images Using Gaussian Splatting", which has been accepted by **Pacific Graphics 2024** (journal track).

## Requirements

* Linux OS
* NVIDIA GPUs. We experimented on A6000 GPUs (cuda 11.8).
* Python libraries: see [environment.yml](./environment.yml). You can use the following commands with Anaconda3 to create and activate your virtual environment:
  - `git clone https://github.com/yec22/Gaussian-DK.git`
  - `cd Gaussian-DK`
  - `conda env create -f environment.yml`
  - `conda activate 3dgs_dk`

## Dataset

## Usage

First, please make sure that all requirements are satisfied and all required files are downloaded (see above steps).

```
# Train with train/test split
python train.py -r 4 -s datasets/dark/piano -m output/piano --port 1111 --eval

# Generate renderings
python render.py -m output/piano

# Compute metrics on renderings
python metrics.py -m output/piano

# More visualization
python render_spherify.py -m output/piano
```
